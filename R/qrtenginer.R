#' @section compatible surveys:
#' A suite of tests have been built to be compatible with the scoring functions
#' provided by the qrtengine package. There are two purposes for these tests
#' being available. One is so that researchers can quickly deploy and analyse
#' data without the burdens of programming. The second is to encourage
#' researchers to work with a standard test suite so that suitable comparisons
#' can be made across studies.
